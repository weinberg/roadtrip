# RoadTrip

Take a RoadTrip cross country with your friends... in your terminal!

RoadTrip is a low intensity casual background game requiring very little interaction and can be played at your own pace while working or doing other activities.

## Design

RoadTrip is a client server application written in Go. The server parts are built to run in containers using either Kubernetes or Docker Compose. The client part is a terminal based application.
